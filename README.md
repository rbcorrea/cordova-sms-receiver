# cordova-sms-receiver

It's beta version and not that much tested Cordova plugin to intercept and read SMS messages.

It's purpose is not to send any message, list messages, ask permissions or anything.

For this moment, I'm going to test it and later I'm planning on updates and release a detailed documentation.

At this time, closed for contributors and not guaranteed fully working version.

It was based on the package released by Raymond Xye, the [cordova-plugin-sms](https://github.com/floatinghotpot/cordova-plugin-sms), but I wanted it simplified.
